## Research Data Management

Climate science has significant public interest, as it affects peopleâ€™s lives, economies, and ecosystems. Effective Research Data Management supports open science initiatives by making data accessible to the public, policymakers, and other stakeholders, increasing transparency, and encouraging public engagement. This openness builds trust and fosters greater awareness and informed decision-making regarding climate action.

Research Data Management underpins the accuracy, reproducibility, and impact of research findings. It supports collaborative and transparent science. In IPCC it helps ensure that investments in the realisation of the assessments continue to benefit scientific inquiry and public policy.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

"The Turing Way", an open science and community-driven project focused on making data science more accessible, understandable, and effective, offers a general overview on the purposes and practices that motivates RDM, illustrating guidelines and useful approaches to put that into practice. 

[Reproducible Research according to the Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm) 

For instance some IPCC Working Groups may propose a [Data Management Plan](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-dmp).
